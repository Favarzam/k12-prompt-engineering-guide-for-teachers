## Advanced Techniques

### Iterative Prompting
Start with a basic prompt, then refine based on results:

```
Initial: "Create a science lesson on mammals"
Refined: "Create a 30-minute science lesson introducing mammals to 1st graders using the 5E model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate)"
Further refined: "Create a 30-minute science lesson introducing mammals to 1st graders using the 5E model. Include animal sounds and movements for kinesthetic learners, picture books for visual learners, and simple classification activities."
```

### Chain Prompting
Break complex tasks into steps:

```
Step 1: "List 10 age-appropriate science vocabulary words about weather for 2nd grade"
Step 2: "Create definitions for these weather words using simple language and examples 2nd graders would understand: [list from step 1]"
Step 3: "Design a matching game using the weather vocabulary and definitions from our previous conversation"
```

### Role-Playing Prompts
```
You are a 4th grade student who is struggling with long division. Ask me questions about the steps you don't understand, and let me practice explaining the concept in simpler terms.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **When AI Responses Are Too Complex:**
- Add "using simple language" or "at a [grade] grade reading level"
- Request "step-by-step instructions"
- Ask for "concrete examples rather than abstract concepts"

### **When Content Isn't Engaging:**
- Specify "make this fun and interactive"
- Add "include movement or hands-on elements"
- Request "connect to [specific student interests]"

### **When You Need More Practical Focus:**
- Include "with materials easily found in classrooms"
- Add "that can be completed in [specific time]"
- Request "with minimal preparation required"
