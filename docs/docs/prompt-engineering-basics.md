## Getting Started with Prompt Engineering

### What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting clear, specific instructions to get the best results from AI tools. Think of it as giving directions to a very capable but literal-minded assistant.

### Basic Principles

#### 1. Be Specific and Clear
‚ùå **Poor**: "Help me with math"
‚úÖ **Better**: "Create 5 word problems involving fractions for 4th graders"

#### 2. Provide Context
‚ùå **Poor**: "Make a quiz"
‚úÖ **Better**: "Create a 10-question multiple choice quiz on photosynthesis for 6th grade students"

#### 3. Set Expectations
‚ùå **Poor**: "Explain gravity"
‚úÖ **Better**: "Explain gravity using simple language and everyday examples for 3rd graders"

#### 4. Use Examples When Helpful
```
Create reading comprehension questions like these examples:
- What is the main character's motivation?
- How does the setting affect the story?
- What evidence supports the author's claim?
```
