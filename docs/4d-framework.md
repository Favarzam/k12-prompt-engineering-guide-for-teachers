## The 4D Framework (Dakan & Feller, 2025)

The 4D Framework helps teachers use AI more effectively and responsibly in education. Each "D" represents a crucial aspect of working with AI tools.

### üéØ **Delegation** - *What should I ask AI to do?*

Delegation is about identifying which tasks are appropriate for AI assistance and which require human expertise.

#### **Ideal for AI Delegation:**
- Creating first drafts of materials
- Generating multiple examples
- Formatting and organizing content
- Adapting materials for different reading levels
- Brainstorming ideas

#### **Keep for Human Expertise:**
- Final content review and approval
- Understanding your specific students' needs
- Making pedagogical decisions
- Providing emotional support
- Assessing actual student work

#### **Guiding Questions for Delegation:**
- "Is this task repetitive or time-consuming for me to do manually?"
- "Can AI help me create a starting point I can refine?"
- "Does this require knowledge of my specific students or classroom?"
- "Am I using AI to enhance my teaching or replace my professional judgment?"

### üìù **Description** - *How do I clearly communicate what I need?*

Description involves crafting clear, specific prompts that lead to useful outputs.

#### **Essential Elements of Good Descriptions:**

**Context Setting:**
```
You are an elementary science teacher creating materials for 3rd graders 
who are learning about animal habitats for the first time.
```

**Task Specification:**
```
Create a lesson plan that includes:
- 10-minute introduction activity
- 20-minute main lesson with examples
- 15-minute hands-on activity
- Assessment questions
```

**Format Requirements:**
```
Format the output as:
- Clear headings for each section
- Bullet points for key concepts
- Simple language appropriate for teachers to read aloud
```

**Constraints and Parameters:**
```
Requirements:
- Use only materials commonly found in classrooms
- Include accommodations for different language backgrounds
- Keep activities under 45 minutes total
- Focus on local ecosystem examples
```

#### **Description Template:**
```
[ROLE]: You are a [subject] teacher for [grade level]
[CONTEXT]: My students are [relevant details about learners]
[TASK]: Create [specific deliverable]
[FORMAT]: Present this as [desired structure]
[CONSTRAINTS]: Make sure to [specific requirements]
[EXAMPLES]: Here's what good [deliverable type] looks like: [example if helpful]
```

### üîç **Discernment** - *How do I evaluate what AI produces?*

Discernment means critically evaluating AI outputs for accuracy, appropriateness, and educational value.

#### **Content Accuracy Checklist:**
- [ ] Are facts correct and up-to-date?
- [ ] Are grade-level expectations appropriate?
- [ ] Do examples match your curriculum standards?
- [ ] Is the difficulty level suitable for your students?

#### **Educational Quality Questions:**
- "Does this align with my learning objectives?"
- "Will this engage my specific students?"
- "Are there any cultural biases or insensitive content?"
- "Does this support students with different languages?"
- "Is the language developmentally appropriate?"

#### **Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Outdated information (especially in science and current events)
- Overly complex vocabulary for the grade level
- Cultural assumptions that don't match your classroom
- Activities requiring unavailable resources
- Safety concerns in hands-on activities

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Diligence** - *How do I use AI responsibly and effectively?*

Diligence encompasses the ongoing responsibilities of using AI tools ethically and professionally.

#### **Professional Responsibilities:**
- Always review and modify AI content before using with students
- Understand your school's AI policy and follow guidelines
- Give proper attribution when sharing AI-generated materials
- Protect student privacy (never input student names or personal information)

#### **Continuous Improvement Questions:**
- "How can I improve my prompts based on the results I'm getting?"
- "What patterns do I notice in helpful vs. unhelpful AI responses?"
- "How is AI saving me time, and how am I using that time to better serve students?"
- "Am I maintaining my professional growth and not becoming overly dependent on AI?"

#### **Ethical Considerations:**
- Use AI to enhance, not replace, your professional expertise
- Be transparent about AI use when appropriate
- Continuously develop your own content creation skills
- Stay informed about AI developments in education
