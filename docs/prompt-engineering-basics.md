# Prompt Engineering Basics for Teachers

### What is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt engineering** is the practice of designing and refining the instructions you give to a large language model (LLM) so it produces useful, accurate, and tailored responses.

Think of it as classroom questioning strategies:

* A vague question (“What do you think?”) often gets vague answers.
* A precise, structured question (“Explain how photosynthesis works in 3 steps, and compare it to making a sandwich”) encourages deeper, more useful answers.

## Core Principles of Prompt Engineering

### 1. **Clarity and Specificity**

LLMs thrive on detail. The more context you provide, the closer the output will match your needs.

* **Vague Prompt:** “Write about ecosystems.”
* **Better Prompt:** “Write a 150-word explanation of ecosystems for high school biology students. Include one example of a desert ecosystem and one of a rainforest.”

### 2. **Role and Perspective**

You can assign the model a role or perspective, which shapes how it responds.

* **Example Roles for Teaching:**

  * *Tutor:* “You are a math tutor. Explain quadratic equations step-by-step.”
  * *Examiner:* “Act as an exam grader. Give me feedback on this student essay and suggest improvements.”
  * *Creative Coach:* “You are a creative writing teacher. Suggest 3 engaging story starters for 7th graders.”

### 3. **Structure and Formatting**

You can tell the model exactly how you want information presented.

* **Examples of Format Instructions:**

  * Lists or bullet points: “Give me 5 key causes of World War I in bullet form.”
  * Tables: “Compare plant and animal cells in a two-column table.”
  * Lesson plan format: “Write a 40-minute lesson plan on fractions with objectives, activities, and assessment.”

### 4. **Level of Complexity**

Models don’t always know the age or level of your audience unless you tell them.

* **Prompt Example:**
  “Explain the concept of democracy in three versions:

  1. For a 3rd grader
  2. For a high schooler
  3. For an adult learner in a civics class.”

This helps differentiate instruction quickly.

### 5. **Iteration (Refinement)**

Prompting is not always one-and-done. You can “converse” with the model to refine answers.

* Step 1: Ask broadly — “Summarize Shakespeare’s *Romeo and Juliet*.”
* Step 2: Refine — “Make the summary 200 words.”
* Step 3: Adapt — “Rewrite it as a modern-day high school story.”

This process is like scaffolding: building toward the version you really want.

### 6. **Constraints and Creativity**

Adding constraints often produces more useful results.

* **Example:**
  “Write a 100-word story about photosynthesis where the sun and a plant are talking to each other, and end with a funny twist.”

Constraints = direction + creativity.

## Prompt Patterns Teachers Can Use

Here are **6 powerful prompt types** you can adapt:

1. **Explain Like…**

   * “Explain Newton’s first law as if you’re teaching a 12-year-old who loves soccer.”

2. **Step-by-Step (Chain of Thought)**

   * “Show your reasoning step by step: How would you solve 24 ÷ 3 × 2?”

3. **Compare and Contrast**

   * “Compare the French and American Revolutions in a table with three similarities and three differences.”

4. **Generate and Evaluate**

   * “Generate 5 multiple-choice questions about fractions. Then give me the answer key and a short explanation for each.”

5. **Transformation**

   * “Turn this short story into a script for a play with 3 characters.”

6. **Socratic Questioning**

   * “Ask me 5 questions that will guide me to understand why the Earth has seasons.”

## Why This Matters in Education

* **Time-saving:** Speeds up prep (lesson plans, worksheets, examples).
* **Differentiation:** Quickly adapts content for various student levels.
* **Critical Thinking:** Models good questioning techniques for students.
* **Digital Literacy:** Helps students learn to “ask machines better questions,” a skill increasingly vital.

### Final Advice for Teachers

* **Think like a teacher giving directions.** The clearer the directions, the better the “student” (the model) performs.
* **Treat the LLM like a collaborator, not a textbook.** Check accuracy and adapt output for your context.
* **Model prompt skills for students.** Teach them how to refine questions, check answers, and reflect on what the model produces.
